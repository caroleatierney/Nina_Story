            <!-- Define paragraphs about Finding Nina -->
            <p> Our family was ready for another dog. We decided we wanted a mini Australian
                Shepherd. We found a breeder and were number 4 on the waiting list. The day before we were going on a
                vacation to Myrtle Beach, we found out that the litter only had four puppies. We were devestated! My
                daughter and I decided that somewhere along our long drive home there had to be a puppy available. We
                searched the internet a lot on our vacation and finally found a breeder a few hours away in North
                Carolina.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> There were two dogs available. Both five months old, a brother and sister. Since
                the brother had a big head we chose the sister, even thought she was eating a rock! Looking back, we
                wish we chose both of them! Our dog was already named Nina and it grew on us fast so we decided not to
                change it. We found out Nina was supposed to be a show dog but was returned at four months because it
                became apparent she had an underbite. She was half price. We don't know why her brother was still
                available...big head?</p>
            <hr>
            <p> The breeder had a very messy home and although it was April, her living room was
                decorated as if Christmas was two days away. The dogs all slept in their own crates that were piled up
                on each other. The yard was all dirt. We decided we weere actually rescuing her!</p>
            <hr>
            <p> On the way out, I asked the breeder if she had been treated for fleas and she said
                yes, but just in case...she slipped a pill in her mouth and vigorousley rubbed her throat while holding
                her mouth closed until she swallowed it. We knew it was time to bolt then!</p>

            <p>Poor Nina was very scared and nervous. She was drooling really bad and then started throwing up.
                Then we realized she was full of fleas! My kids were freaked out and didn't want to be near her!</p>
